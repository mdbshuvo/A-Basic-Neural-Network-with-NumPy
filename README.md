# A-Basic-Neural-Network-with-NumPy
In my machine learning laboratory course, I built a basic neural network class using only NumPy, rather than deeplearning libraries like Tensorflow or Keras. The class can generate multi-layered fully connected neural networks (FCNs) that can be trained and used easily. In this project a dataset was produced by our class to train and test the networks. The dataset can't be shared for privacy reasons.

The dataset was pre-processed for the training and testing purpose using pandas and scikit-learn. Then a network is created with two layers having three and four neurons respectively. The network can't be too big because bigger network results into exploding gradients, which was not addressed, as it was meant to be a simple implementation. The network then trained and tested with the private dataset.
